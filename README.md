# LAPS Password Manager
LAPS Password Manager is a custom application for managing LAPS passwords. It has the same functionality as the LAPS UI but looks a whole lot nicer :)

## Instructions
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Run the LAPS Password Manager executable. If your antivirus doesn't like the executable or you don't trust it, run the LAPS Password Manager.ps1 script instead.
